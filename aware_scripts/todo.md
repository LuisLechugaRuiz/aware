A folder to save scripts to interact over Aware system.

This folder should contain scripts that will help the user to use the system as good as possible.

Should we move here the scripts used to SETUP the configurations externally?

So far I'm creating setup folders inside the system at:
- Process State Machine
- Agent
- Communication

It might make sense to move them here so we can setup everything properly.

Centralizing the scripts that we use to interact with our system.
