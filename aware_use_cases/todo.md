# Use cases

In the future we should split the different folders into submodules

This is:

Capabilities: To be used by agents
Event adapters: To add new event_types with ease into the system.
Memory adapters: To add new input sources into the memory of specific agents.

Ideally this should be independet of core architecture as they will be used by different clients using the interfaces defined on core.
