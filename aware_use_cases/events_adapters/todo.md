This folder should contain all the adapters to add new events to the system

The adapters are used to translate external events into internal events that should be processed by our system.

The first example should contain:
- A adapter that supervises a specific web and triggers an event internally when a new "post" is included into the web.

This can also includes adapters such as:

- New email
- New message (tweet, linkedin..........)
