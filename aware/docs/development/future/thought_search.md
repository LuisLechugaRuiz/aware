# Thought search improvements

Thought search on existing memories.

In the future we should add the possibility to constraint thought search using initial date and final date!

We should also prioritize latest info, but for this it will be FUNDAMENTAL to save not only the reflection of experiences, but also reflection over the thoughts themselve, this way the most relevant thoughts will be automatically merged into new representations, this way we can just filter by time and at certain moment just prune very olds thought as they MUST have been used again to create new ones and the better they are the most that they will repeat. Maybe this is how our memory makes sense overtime, instead of updating all the datapoints it just need to create new connections that already integrate certain knowledge so it can "decrease" the energy of older connections and evolve overtime.
