Some ideas

What if each tool can have internal variables?

This way we define the variable at database automatically and give back based on the process_ids.
This would be effective to avoid polluting other information channels. This is the right one.

Instead of working on requests I decided to address the limitations of passing tools variables over the system. We need a way to ensure that some variables are stored for the process using them.

For this I started the implementation to implement capability, both on database and backend. Next we need to integrate it totally (redis) and do also the variable implementation to be able to fetch the existing local variables. We have a get_variable("name", "default_value" (optional empty)) and it gives us variable at each time. On POST (once we call each tool) we should have a "update_variables" function that help us to store all new data!! This is the clearer way to ensure we save info per tool avoiding using internal communication protocols which are reserved to process to process comm.
