Some creativity today.

On first place now we have Client() class and we should do the same for Server, Publisher and Subscriber.

They also need to be implemented properly on databases.

Now we can use this classes inside our logic:

Client is used inside tool to create_requests, publisher should be added for function publish.

Subsciber and Server are actived once a request or a topic has been publisher and in this case what it should do will be different, but is contemplated already on ProcessHandler!!!!
### TODO:

- Determine if we need to create also server and subscriber or they are handled properly from request/topic, when they are created on process handler.
- Finish implementation of temporal functions created at communications.json.
- Finish implementation of TeamBuilder class (remember, now assistant has clients to communicated with: TeamBuilder (create_team) and TeamLeaders (assign_task). TeamBuilder sends requests to create_agent to AgentBuilder. WE DON'T NEED ORCHESTRATOR ANYMORE!! team_leader has request to inform_user where assistant is service.

# NEXT

- First make the refactor of communications to have the protocols instead of the messages itself. It should contain the clients/servers..... This way we can later use them from tools as needed.
