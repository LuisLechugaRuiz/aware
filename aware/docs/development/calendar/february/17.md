Now we have an logic to represent state machines associated to each agent (specific to agent).
We also have state machine for internal states, main difference is flow_type, but we can use similar concept (reading it with JSON parser).

What we are missing is to modify agent builder to read this data for the config file of each.

## Steps:

### Config folder imp:
- Implement a reader so we can parse from JSON and start the agent and the processes automatically.
- Define internal process state machine based on similar concept (but this requires different transitions), leave this for the future!
- For now we just initiate agents and processes based on config folder.

### Prompt adapting for internal processes and default agents:
- Then compare current Aware prompt with the results of our meta-prompts.
- Adapt the config until achieving same behavior.

### Cleanup
- Cleanup tools and prompts.

### Agent builder
- Finish agent builder implementation including profile for default agents!!
