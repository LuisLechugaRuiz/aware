Back on track.

Finished internal logic to translate from JSON format to OpenAI with minimum implementation using our existing logic.

Using PydanticParser from JsonPydanticParser to have the same translation -> Function to OpenAI format but adding str to Function.


## TODO:
- implement the new variables at requests so we can convert it into correct function.
- address client / server to get requests and topic / subscribers for topic, same for event. NewCommunicationProtocol should have these options and then be used properly at process_handler.
