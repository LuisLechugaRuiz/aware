# Morning

Starting with highest prio input.

We need two things:
- Ensure we are always running one until it finishes and then add the next one.
- Treat it different depending on the type (Event - Request - Action).

## EF
Rejected from EF. Time to create a MVP while opening new possibilities.

Aware needs to work first.


## Afternoon.

Implemented most of the logic with abstractions to get the functions and use them when needed.
But now we need to also PROCESS the messages internally... with this new format we are skipping CommunicationHandler so we don't add messages anymore... how to manage this???
Maybe all at CommunicationDispatcher???
