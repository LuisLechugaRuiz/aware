# Morning

Starting with highest prio input.

We need two things:
- Ensure we are always running one until it finishes and then add the next one.
- Treat it different depending on the type (Event - Request - Action).

## EF
Rejected from EF. Time to create a MVP while opening new possibilities.

Aware needs to work first.


## Afternoon.

Implemented most of the logic with abstractions to get the functions and use them when needed.
But now we need to also PROCESS the messages internally... with this new format we are skipping CommunicationHandler so we don't add messages anymore... how to manage this???
Maybe all at CommunicationDispatcher??? Rethink this. I think we don't need to add any message to the client itself as it is just a function call, it should have a response (or a placeholder when REQUEST????)

## Night

Updated the logic at communication protocols with new interfaces.

NEXT:
- Ensure proper CommunicationHandler utility, check if we can remove it and move the logic to communication protocols.
- Ensure proper usage at Process - How to ensure that we stop the process when creating a request???? ....
- Check implementation along with ProcessHandler and CommunicationDispatcher.
