# Afternoon

Added logic at ProcessHandler to obtain the CommunicationProtocols properly:

Highest priority input can be:

- Request.
- Event.
- Action.

In case one of them is being processed just get existing one.

Otherwise get highest priority one.

In both cases we also need to save the protocol that is being used to manage it.

### NEXT:

In the protocols we need a way to update the SPECIFIC input only.

i.e:
when calling set_request_completed it should be the current input.

This might need a modification in the protocol to include the id of current input being proccessed? TBD!!

Maybe at InputProtocol we can add the Input

As we should only use the InputProtocol when an Input exists, otherwise we only use the OutputProtocols which can be used by process to create new primitives.

### Steps
- Address the input properly.
- Address the limitation with CommunicationHandler and remove it as now we should just CommunicationProtocol.

Then we should address the CommunicationDispatcher (for now just add it as a class for each of the protocols, but it might need decoupling async in the future with Celery).

After that lets go back to ProcessHandler and address current limitations, but we should be very close to have the communications working properly.
