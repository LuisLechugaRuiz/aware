# Happy birthday KING!

Such a day to start doing the new UI!!

We already have the starting points.

Now we have a setup process that for now just creates the org and it doesn't look good, but soon we should enhance it with the next steps and split the setup of each of these step so is very clear and we can create later then on demand

## Order:
- Organization
- Team
- Agent
- Process State

Then create the communications:
- between the different agents -> client / services.
- On top of that we should add topics / events.
