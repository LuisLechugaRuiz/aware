# Market

Some ideas started from 0 to 1 from Peter Thiel:

## Create a monopoly.


### Techonology + Brand + Scalability. 

(Aware have technology + scalability, is important to define brand principles:

- help humannity
- decentralize intelligence.

### Start on a small market.

Which are the main benefits of Aware compared to similar platforms?

Aware is designed from scratch to be an assistant, it combines communication with users with actions from AI while managing different data.

Searching a good market where there is not much competition, big urgency and big scalability I think the best one would be: HOSPITALS.

As discusses with Aeolus Robotics, Aware can provide a UI for the users to talk with the AI, the AI can be influenced based on user history and some instructions.

Benefits:
- Provide fast assistance.
- Share info users - hospital workers thanks to advance conversation.
- Help hospital workers to take the best decisions with the help of advanced LLMs for medicine.

This would be very scalable and help society a lot, a dream initial market.


### Long term

We should still aim to coordinate the tasks of any company (Jira - Confluence - Notion implementations), but this market is much bigger (similar to personal assistance with email + calendar).
So in the long run we should still aim to provide this functionality while in the short term we aim for this market.
