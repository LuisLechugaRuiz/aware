What if requests are python functions?

Why is this useful? They can be implemented to perform a different action when someone calls it.
So instead of using the request the return of calling the function is routed to the server while the client calls it.

So in summary:
The request is a python function that is called by the agent and it can perform an arbitrary task (apart from sending it to the agent.) So in general it should be part of toolkit then.

So what if instead of creating a request any agent can add his OWN tool as part of the request? THE SERVER HAVE TO HAVE IT INSTALLED. THERE IS NO NEED FOR REQUEST.JSON is the TOOL OF THE SERVER!!

IT CAN BE CALLED BY THE CLIENT!!!! NICE.
