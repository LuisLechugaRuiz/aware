Now that we are understanding that we need to create_services with structured info for each agent to satisfy requests, we need a way to identify this communications, how is the information going to be distributed.

This is where the concept team makes sense. A team is a constrained group of agent that is focused on solving a spectrum of the possible requests.

This will help to solve recurrent tasks in a flexible way thanks to the combination of different agents that collaborate to solve the task.

When we think about creating an agent we are not creating the agent standalone, we are creating it in a specific context.

So an agent can't be created in the vacum. The agent builder should be created with info from the manager of a team which is designing the communication protocols that will be used to solve the task.
