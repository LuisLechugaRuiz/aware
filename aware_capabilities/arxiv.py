# TODO: Get inspiration from:
# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/community/langchain_community/utilities/arxiv.py

# Remember our goal, we should be able to instrospect the package properly using similar to RAPTOR.
#   At the same time this paper will be stored in the memory of the agent itself so the thought generator can access it.

# For documents we should replicate raptor but instead of just summaries we store learnings extracted from the document with potential queries?
